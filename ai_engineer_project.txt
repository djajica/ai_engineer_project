AI Engineer – Project Specification

Overview
Build a Python-based ML service that supports model inference and/or training. The use case can be freely chosen and is not the primary point of evaluation. Some examples of possible projects:
Simple classifier service that supports creating new models through an API (possibly with model configuration parameters), training models, and running inference with trained models
LLM service that integrates external components (e.g. vector DB, web search) to retrieve information relevant to user queries
A service that uses pre-trained models (e.g. from Hugging Face) and exposes an endpoint where users can submit samples for inference (e.g. classifying a piece of text)
Project time estimate: 6-8 hours
Requirements
Project defines an API, possibly with multiple endpoints
Code quality: readability, modularity, error handling
Best practices: project structure, testing, reproducibility, maintainability
Deliverables
GitHub repository
Presentation of the project (10-15 minutes)
Notes
We want to see how you would build a fully-fledged software project, so try focusing more on applying best practices and clean code. Even a simple project can impress if it’s well written 😊
